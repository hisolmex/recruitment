TODO:
0. Create a public GIT repo so we can look it up later, and place the package files there before you begin the work.
If you cannot make it public for some reason, make sure to pack whole project along with .git folder when you're done, and send it back via email.

1. Prepare a responsive checkout according to the design file `acme-checkout.pdf`. Beware! There're some tiny design bugs, hope you'll fix them :) .
Hint: Font used in design is Roboto 400 (Regular) and Roboto 700 (Bold) - you can get them at `https://fonts.google.com/`.

   1. Implement data validation on all the checkout inputs, so the checkout button on the bottom is only enabled when data is valid.

   2. For under 767px the menu should be converted to "hamburger" icon and expand when touched. Design according to the design file found in the app root `acme-checkout.pdf`. Hint: Icons and images are in assets folder.
